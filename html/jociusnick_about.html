				<h2>About the Artist</h2>
				<p>Cathey Reynolds is a native Texas having lived in Houston and 34 years in Austin.  She returned to her first love, painting, several years ago after careers as a teacher, school counselor, and private practice therapist.  
				She had the experience of growing up on 15 acres of land with horses, dogs, cats, and one pig.  Cathey found that being in nature both relaxed her and stimulated her senses with the variety of colors, shapes, and textures.  That started her interest in painting as a way to capture those feelings.
				Her work involves using oils to paint seascapes and landscapes.  She is also dabbling in abstract art and impressionistic styles of art.  
				</p>
				<p id="statement">I have always used nature as inspiration for my paintings.  The variety of colors, shapes, and textures is unlimited and I recreate this in my oil paintings. I combine brush with palette knife techniques to bring a sense of depth to my pieces.  Since nature creates one-of-a-kind things, I have decided to do the same:  no painting will be done twice.  
				Nature offered me a place of serenity and beauty so I strive to reflect that in my work.  I want to evoke a feeling of peace and joy when someone looks at my art.
